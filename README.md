# Complex Networks Visualizations

This repository contains Python scripts for generating and visualizing different properties of **complex networks**, including:
- Degree distributions (Poisson, Binomial, Power-Law, Exponential, Stretched Exponential, Log-Normal)
- Structural properties (Clustering, Small-World, Community Structure, Assortativity)
- Graph visualizations with `networkx` and `matplotlib`

These examples are intended as didactic tools for exploring the fundamentals of **Network Science**.

## Requirements
The code is written in Python and uses the following main packages:
- `networkx`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy` (optional, for some distributions)

Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install networkx numpy matplotlib scipy

---

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the scripts directly:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
python scriptname.py
```

Each script generates visualizations of a particular network property.
